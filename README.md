# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

This application provides an example of the use of a server-side API to create a dynamic Weather Dashboard. It allows the user to search various cities to provide a current weather forecast and provide a 5 day future forecast. This application uses multiple api calls, all using Open Weather Map API. We also included use of the Local Storage to keep a record of previous searches. This was all tied together with HTML and Bootstrap to provide a clean application.

This weather dashboard has features such as:
* A search bar to search for cities.
* A history list, to provide user with a saved copy of previous searches for easy access.
* An area to show the current forecast, this includes a Date, an icon to portray the weather, Temperature (Â°C), Humidity (%) and Wind Speed (Meters/second).
* An area showing a forecast for the next 5 days including all the elements as the current forecast.

## Usage
